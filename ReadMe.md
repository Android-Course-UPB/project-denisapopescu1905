# üèôÔ∏è  CityAirQ: Urban Air Quality Monitoring Android Application

CityAirQ is a reliable air quality monitoring solution part of an IoT network for tracking urban pollution. Designed to collect air pollutant parameters through a device attached to bycicles, the application displays live and historical pollution data, together with dynamic charts, pollution prediction heat maps, personalized routing and warning alarms. The Android Jetpack Compose application, deployed and tested on various mobile Android releases, provides a robust data flow communication between components using BLE, support for data visualization and accessibility, easily turning any bicycle into a powerful environmental tool.

## Context

Author: Ioana-Denisa Popescu SRIC1A

Air quality monitoring is potentially the most important short-term solutions when it comes to reducing health risks and preserving ecosystems in the future, especially in heavily populated cities. By anticipating and visualizing this unseen phenomenon on the mobile application, metropolitan inhabitants can stay in touch with the air pollution levels in the area at all times and be alerted when air quality indicator values become remarkably high.

## Architecture
### System Architecture
1. **ESP32 Device**: Collects air quality data, connects via BLE
2. **Mobile Application**: Displays real-time data, handles BLE and network communication
3. **Cloud System**: Ingests data, stores in QuestDB, runs AI for predictions

The app enables communication between modules of the architecture, following the data life cycle, from initial collection (through pollution tracking devices), to sending collected values to the cloud-based pipeline and, after thorough analysis and processing, receiving and displaying results, in forms of dynamic maps, predictions and alerts.

## Design Pattern - MVVMC (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)
- Separation of UI, data flow, and back-end logic
- Low memory usage and lifecycle-friendly architecture
- Enhanced navigation without loss of state

## üì° Data Flow

### 1. BLE GATT Communication
- ESP32 devices act as **GATT servers**
- BLE clients on Android scan and connect using UUIDs
- Sensor values transferred using `Notify` characteristics

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d689a7fe-626f-421e-985c-fb4002f5c513" alt="BLE Diagram" width="600" />
</div>

### 2. Cloud Communication
- JSON payload via HTTP POST every 30s:
```json
{
  "clientId": "clientId-ec85695bd6a1fdaa",
  "timestamp": 1718699160,
  "location": {
    "latitude": 44.384256,
    "longitude": 26.0866048
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "dimension": "Temperature",
      "value": 35
    },
    {
      "dimension": "Humidity",
      "value": 67
    }
  ]
}
```
- A similar POST request is transmitted every 30s to get map results.
